      <h3>What does "semantics" mean?</h3>
      <p>Before we can understand what HTML semantic elements are, we need to understand what <em>semantics</em> means. Merriam-Webster defines semantics* as "the study of meanings". A more detailed description is <em>the historical and psychological study and the classification of changes in the signification of words or forms viewed as factors in linguistic development</em>.</p>

    <aside>
      <h4 style="margin-left: 40px">So what does <em>that</em> mean?</h4>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">This simply means words have meaning. For instance, curse words have a negative connotation because humans <u>give</u> them a negative connotation. We could just as easily use the word "fork*" as a four-letter curse word but we don't because we want "fork" to mean <em>an implement with two or more prongs used especially for taking up (as in eating), pitching, or digging</em>.</p>

      <h3>Okay, then what are semantic elements in HTML?</h3>
      <p>Semantic elements have changed the way we code in HTML. HTML elements used to provide direction for how the page would be presented or how it would look, but offered no real meaning. Semantic HTML tags actually say what they mean. We can use elements such as: <strong>header</strong>, <strong>body</strong>, <strong>aside</strong>, and <strong>figure</strong> to divide our content and provide meaning to various sections. You may ask why this is important: doesn’t dividing the content using the old <strong>div</strong> element accomplish the same thing? The simple answer is yes. However in language we give words meanings. These meanings ensure everyone understands that when we go into a store to buy a dining “table*” we are looking for a <em>smooth flat slab fixed on legs</em>. By using semantic elements that actually say what we mean (such as <strong>header</strong> or <strong>video</strong>), we can all understand what is being accomplished in the code.</p>

      <h3>What are the benefits of semantic elements?</h3>
      <p>Besides the obvious benefit of elements having meaning, using known semantic elements allows for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>browser support across all modern browsers,</li>
          <li>programs and applications to understand your page,</li>
          <li>improved SEO,</li>
          <li>developers to understand their and other's code without additional effort.</li>
        </ul>
